# UI & API Automation Framework

This project demonstrates how to use **Playwright** to automate Web application and API testing using **Typescript (Node.js)**. It follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** for better maintainability and scalability.


## Project Information
- **Project:** SauceDemo Application & PetStore API Testing  
- **Prepared By:** Rochelle Abeywickrama 
- **Tools:** Playwright & TypeScript 
- **Design Pattern:** Page Object Model (POM), Data-driven + fixtures 
- **Reporting:** Playwright HTML Reporter / Allure 
- **Applications Under Test:**  
  - [SauceDemo UI Application](https://www.saucedemo.com/)  
  - [Petstore API Collection](https://petstore.swagger.io/#/)
- **Key Advantages:**  
    - Reusable Page Objects for UI elements
    - Consistent API request handling
    - Easy CI/CD integration
    - Clear separation of test data, page objects, and tests
